      Khet Guru is a revolutionary tool that puts the power of smart
      agriculture directly into the hands of farmers. Using soil fertility
      data, Khet Guru provides farmers with the essential knowledge needed to
      make informed decisions about crop selection, planting times, and
      fertilizer use.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more guesswork. No more uncertainty. Khet Guru takes into account
      your location, the time of year, and the local climate, offering
      tailored recommendations for crops that are most likely to thrive in
      your specific conditions. But it doesn't stop there. Khet Guru goes a
      step further, calculating the precise amount of fertilizer you'll need
      and even estimating the associated costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Khet Guru, you're not just farming; you're farming smart.
